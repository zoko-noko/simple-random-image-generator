# simple-random-image-generator
A simple Javascript app, which uses Unsplash to generate a random image and print it.
# How it works
When you click the generate button, it generates a number between 1 and 10.000 and adds it at the end of the url(?sig=$number). It does this to trick the browser into thinkning that it is diffrent url's, so you don't get the image twice. 
# Beginner friendly
This is my first web app.
